simplifyweb
===========

Developing a web application involves making a suite of choices viz 
Server side technology, Client side technology , Databases, Cloud. 

Server side technologies: Java Fx, Faces, Oracle ADF- J2EE ecosystem. Python Django, LAMP stack, Node js et cetra. 

Client Side technologies: 
There are a ton of java script libraries out there and the complexity is immense. 
JQuery - Javascript library which is easy to use and simplified java script development
Knockout - Another JS library which enables declarative binding automated UI refresh et cetra. 
Bootstrap - Responseive Web UI
Backbone - Decouple DOM from data. 
D3JS - Client side charting capabilities. 

To develop a web application one has to invest resources in many of the technologies listed/not listed above. Neither provides a magic pill solution and web applications devleopment time is directly proportional to number of resources

Features of this framework: 
Declaraticve and Hybrid (server side + client side framework) framework
Reduce Web application development time 
Leverage the best web technologies available and abstract them with a declarative framework
Note: Abstraction-> does not necessarily mean kill the link to the lower level frameworks as we understand some customizations may require fine control on lower level libraries.
